## ** Important NOTE **
1) If .cproject and .project files are missing from workspace you need to first create an empty embedded C project with the same name then copy over all relevant files to the folder. Cproject files have been lost or disappeared by backing them up so you need to regenerate them by making the new empty project.

2) If .cproject and .project files are still there. Open the project in Atollic by opening the .cproject file directly by clicking on it in the windows file browser.

3) Or just try import project normally but it gets weird sometimes so \o/ "do this at own risk"
